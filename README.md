# Multi Function Calculator

Hi! Welcome to the Multi Function Calculator.

## Using it

It's quite easy! 
First of all, type a number in the input bar (where you should read "type a number").

Then, click the plus button next to the input bar, aaand...

Choose sum the numbers, get the average, or multiply them. If you want to clear the box that contains the numbers, 
just click the Clear All button, that is below the operations buttons.

Here you can try it: https://ziadi21.github.io/Calculator/ :)
